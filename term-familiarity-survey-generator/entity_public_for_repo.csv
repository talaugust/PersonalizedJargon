Market models start with an initial implied volatility surface and a diffusion specification for the implied volatility dynamics, and derive the no-arbitrage constraints on the risk-neutral drift of the dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which specifies the security price and the implied volatility dynamics while leaving the instantaneous variance rate dynamics unspecified, and derives the allowable shape for the initial implied volatility surface based on dynamic no-arbitrage arguments. We propose two parametric specifications for the implied volatility dynamics that lead to extreme tractability, as the whole implied volatility surface is determined by a quadratic equation. The paper also proposes a dynamic calibration methodology and calibrates the two models to over-the-counter currency option and equity index option implied volatility surfaces over an 11-year period. The model with lognormal implied variance dynamics generates superior performance over standard option pricing models of similar complexities. Furthermore, constructing implied volatility surfaces using our two models is 100 times faster than using traditional option pricing models.",28,"Implied volatility

The crosslinking reaction involves the UV light-induced thiol-ene (click) chemistry, and the phase separation, occurring during the crosslinking step, generates a fully interconnected porous structure in the membrane. The porosity is on the order of the micrometer scale and the membrane shows a gradient of pore size across the membrane cross-section. The membrane can separate polystyrene latex particles of different size and undergoes actuation in contact with acetone due to the asymmetric porous structure.",8,"Crosslinking

 Alcohol use and antidepressant prescription are prevalent in many countries, but little is known about their combined effects.
 

 

 OBJECTIVE
 Having been surprised by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant-treated patients who became prone to pathological intoxication, we examined this association, searching for relevant literature and cases.
 

 

 METHODS
 A detailed literature search showed little or no interaction between SSRIs and alcohol in laboratory studies, and inconsistent effects of these drugs in problem drinkers. We collected cases to study from our own and colleagues' practices, regulatory agencies and web-based discussion fora, and considered evidence for interactions according to standard criteria.
 

 

 RESULTS
 Pathological intoxication, characterized by unexpected and often gross disinhibition, was identified in 100 of 201 reports that provided enough detail to be evaluated. Memory impairment was prominent in just over half (53/100) of these. Outcomes included serious violence; homicide occurred in 8 cases, including two double and one triple homicide (12 deaths).
 

 

 CONCLUSIONS
 Multiple lines of evidence amplify a thus far barely recognized signal of interactions of SSRI and related antidepressants with alcohol. Systematic collection of further data is required to further characterize this syndrome, but in the meantime effective warnings must be introduced to alert prescribers and patients to the serious risk of pathological intoxication during antidepressant treatment.",23,"Pathological intoxication

But if robots are to master everyday manipulation, they need general problem-solving capabilities as humans have. We have developed commonsense reasoning methods to make qualitative spatio-temporal inferences about manipulation tasks performed by humans and robots. Hence, robots are enabled to reason about a wider spectrum of tasks, which will considerably deepen their understanding of everyday manipulation.",5,"Robots

Considering the different response times of the gas and power systems, the transient gas flow and steady-state power flow are combined to formulate the dynamic optimal energy flow in the integrated gas and power systems. With proper assumptions and simplifications, the problem is transformed into a single-stage linear programming to obtain the optimal operation strategy for both gas and power systems. Simulation on the test case illustrates the success of the modeling and the beneficial roles of the power-to-gas are analyzed. The proposed model can be used in the decision support for both planning and operation of the coordinated natural gas and electrical power systems.",201,"Integrated gas and electrical power system

A saturated tracking controller is designed by utilizing hyperbolic tangent functions to reduce the risk of actuator saturation. Adaptive robust techniques are adopted to guarantee the robustness of the control system against unknown parameters and external disturbances. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded and tracking errors are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",5,"Control system

By determining the distribution of transport properties, we confirm that waves are localized in the bulk and localization is suppressed in edge states. Our system provides a new platform for investigating the transport properties of photons in the presence of synthetic gauge fields.",185,"Transport properties

Historically, women with more education have been the least likely to marry and have children, but this marriage gap has eroded as the returns to marriage have changed. Marriage and remarriage rates have risen for women with a college degree relative to women with fewer years of education. However, the patterns of, and reasons for, marriage have changed. College educated women marry later, have fewer children, are less likely to view marriage as ""financial security"", are happier in their marriages and with their family life, and are not only the least likely to divorce, but have had the biggest decrease in divorce since the 1970s compared to women without a college degree. In contrast, there have been fewer changes in marital patterns by education for men.",268,"Marriage

This phenomenon, known as the ""bottleneck effect"" is here revisited from a different perspective, by using confined displacements of interfacial fluids. Compared to standard microfluidics, such effect admits in this case a neat quantitative characterization, which reveals intrinsic material characteristics of flowing monolayers and permits to envisage strategies for their controlled micromanipulation.",8,"Microfluidics
